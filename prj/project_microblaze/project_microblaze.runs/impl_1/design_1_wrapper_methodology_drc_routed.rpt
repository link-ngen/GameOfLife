2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset_rtl relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 sys_clk_pin sys_clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin sys_clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on tx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin sys_clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-38#1 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 20 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-38#2 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 22 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-38#3 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 26 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-38#4 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 28 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint
Related violations: <none>
